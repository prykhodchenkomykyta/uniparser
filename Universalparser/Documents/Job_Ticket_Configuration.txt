To generate Job Tickets in XLSX format, the following steps need to be followed:

Prerequisites:
On LINUX:
 		sudo apt install python3-pip
		sudo apt install python3
		sudo pip3 install openpyxl

	•	Python 3.11.2 or higher should be installed on the machine.
	•	Master-Product-ID list in XLSX format.
	•	Job-Ticket Template in XLSX format.

Instructions:
	•	Install Python on the machine.
	•	Move the Master-Product-ID list file (XLSX) to the configuration-folder of the uniparser. Ensure that the file name does not contain any spaces.
	•	Move the Job-Ticket Template file (XLSX), which will be used to create the Job-Ticket, to the configuration-folder of the uniparser. Ensure that the file name does not contain any spaces.
	•	Configure the JOB_TICKET_XLSX section in the Output_Configuration.json. following fields of the JOB_TICKET_XLSX need configuration:
		o	"MasterProductID": Path of the Master Product ID list (XLSX file).
		o	"SchemaJobTicket": Path of the Job-Ticket Template.
		o	"SheetNameMasterPID": Name of the sheet in the MasterPID file to be used in the Job-Ticket.
		o	"FieldMap_ProdConfig_MasterPID": List of fields used to map data between product_config.csv and MasterProductID.xlsx files.
		o	"FieldsToWrite": List of fields from product_config.csv to be used in the Job-Ticket. The field name "JobTicketNumber" must be included in this list.
		o	"CellIndexOfFieldsToWrite": List of cell locations in the Job-Ticket where fields in "FieldsToWrite" should be written.
		o	"FieldsToWriteFromMasterPID": List of fields from the MasterPID list to be used in the Job-Ticket.
		o	"CellIndexForMasterPIDFieldsToWrite": List of cell locations in the Job-Ticket where fields in "FieldsToWriteFromMasterPID" should be written.
	•	In the UniversalParser_SystemConfig.csv file, add "JOB_TICKET_XLSX" to the OutputFilesToCreate field to enable Job-Ticket XLSX file generation.

Note:
	•	Ensure that file names, field header names, sheet names, and field names in the MasterPID file do not contain any spaces.
	•	The CardStockID field in the MasterPID list should not be empty. If there is no CardStockID for a product, the corresponding CardStockID field should have the value "NA".
